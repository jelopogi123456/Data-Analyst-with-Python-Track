Importing Python modules
Modules (sometimes called packages or libraries) help group together related sets of tools in Python. In this exercise, we'll examine two modules that are frequently used by Data Scientists:

statsmodels: used in machine learning; usually aliased as sm
seaborn: a visualization library; usually aliased as sns
Note that each module has a standard alias, which allows you to access the tools inside of the module without typing as many characters. For example, aliasing lets us shorten seaborn.scatterplot() to sns.scatterplot().

Instructions 1/3
35 XP
1
In the script editor, use an import statement to import statsmodels without an alias.


Take Hint (-10 XP)

# Use an import statement to import statsmodels
import statsmodels 

# Import statsmodels under the alias sm

# Import statsmodels under the alias sm
import statsmodels as sm

Add an as statement to alias seaborn to sns.
# Use an import statement to import seaborn with alias sns
import seaborn as sns

Correcting a broken import
In this exercise, we'll learn to import numpy, a module for performing mathematical operations on lists of data. The standard alias for numpy is np.

What did you need to change to make the import run without errors?

Instructions 1/2

2
Fix the import of numpy to run without errors.

# Fix the import of numpy to run without errors
import numpy as np

Question
What did you need to change to make the import run without errors?

Python is case-sensitive, so numpy must be all lowercase.

Exercise
Exercise
Creating a float
Before we start looking for Bayes' kidnapper, we need to fill out a Missing Puppy Report with details of the case. Each piece of information will be stored as a variable.

We define a variable using an equals sign (=). For instance, we would define the variable height:

height = 24
In this exercise, we'll be defining bayes_age to be 4.0 months old. The data type for this variable will be float, meaning that it is a number.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a variable called bayes_age and set it equal to 4.0.
Display the variable bayes_age.

# Fill in Bayes' age (4.0)
bayes_age = 4.0

# Display the variable bayes_age
print(bayes_age)

Creating strings
Let's continue to fill out the Missing Puppy Report for Bayes. In the previous exercise, we defined bayes_age, which was a float, which represents a number.

In this exercise, we'll define favorite_toy and owner, which will both be strings. A string represents text. A string is surrounded by quotation marks (' or ") and can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. It doesn't matter if you use single (') or double (") quotes, but it's important to be consistent throughout your code.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a variable called favorite_toy whose value is "Mr. Squeaky".
Define a variable called owner whose value is 'DataCamp'.
Show the values assigned to these variables.

# Bayes' favorite toy
favorite_toy = 'Mr. Squeaky'

# Bayes' owner
owner = 'DataCamp'

# Display variables
print(favorite_toy)
print(owner)


Correcting string errors
It's easy to make errors when you're trying to type strings quickly.

Don't forget to use quotes! Without quotes, you'll get a name error.
owner = DataCamp
Use the same type of quotation mark. If you start with a single quote, and end with a double quote, you'll get a syntax error.
fur_color = "blonde'
Someone at the police station made an error when filling out the final lines of Bayes' Missing Puppy Report. In this exercise, you will correct the errors.

Instructions
100 XP
Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without producing syntax errors.

# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors
birthday = '2017-07-14'
case_id = 'DATACAMP!123-456?'

Valid variable names
Which of the following is not a valid variable name?
3dogs



Load a DataFrame
A ransom note was left at the scene of Bayes' kidnapping. Eventually, we'll want to analyze the frequency with which each letter occurs in the note, to help us identify the kidnapper. For now, we just need to load the data from ransom.csv into Python.

We'll load the data into a DataFrame, a special data type from the pandas module. It represents spreadsheet-like data (something with rows and columns).

We can create a DataFrame from a CSV (comma-separated value) file by using the function pd.read_csv().

Instructions
100 XP
Use pd.read_csv() to load data from a CSV file called ransom.csv. This file represents the frequency of each letter in the ransom note for Bayes.

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load the 'ransom.csv' into a DataFrame
r = pd.read_csv('ransom.csv')

# Display DataFrame
print(r)

Correcting a function error
The code in the script editor should plot information from the DataFrame that we loaded in the previous exercise.

However, there is an error in function syntax. Remember that common function errors include:

Forgetting closing parenthesis
Forgetting commas between each argument
Note that all arguments to the functions are correct. The problem is in the function syntax.

Instructions
100 XP
Correct the code so that it runs without syntax errors.

# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors

# Plot a graph
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)

# Display the graph
plt.show()

Snooping for suspects
We need to narrow down the list of suspects for the kidnapping of Bayes. Once we have a list of suspects, we'll ask them for writing samples and compare them to the ransom note.

A witness to the crime noticed a green truck leaving the scene of the crime whose license plate began with 'FRQ'. We'll use this information to search for some suspects.

As a detective, you have access to a special function called lookup_plate.

lookup_plate accepts one positional argument: A string representing a license plate.

Instructions 1/3

Calling lookup_plate() with the license plate FRQ**** produced too many results. Luckily, lookup_plate() also accepts a keyword argument: color. Use the color of the car ('Green') to get a smaller list.

# Define plate to represent a plate beginning with FRQ
# Use * to represent the missing four letters
plate = 'FRQ****'

# Call the function lookup_plate()
lookup_plate(plate)

# Call lookup_plate() with the keyword argument for color
lookup_plate(plate, color='Green')

Loading a DataFrame
We're still working hard to solve the kidnapping of Bayes, the Golden Retriever. Previously, we used a license plate spotted at the crime scene to narrow the list of suspects to:

Fred Frequentist
Ronald Aylmer Fisher
Gertrude Cox
Kirstine Smith
We've obtained credit card records for all four suspects. Perhaps some of them made suspicious purchases before the kidnapping?

The records are in a CSV called "credit_records.csv".

Instructions

Import the pandas module under the alias pd.
Load the CSV "credit_records.csv" into a DataFrame called credit_records.
Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method.

# Display the results
print(items)

Correcting column selection errors
A junior detective tried to access the location columns of credit_records, but he made some mistakes. Help correct his code so that we can search for suspicious purchases.

In all exercises going forward, pandas will be imported as pd. The DataFrame credit_records has already been imported.

Instructions

Question
Why did this code generate an error?

name = mpr.Dog Name

If a column name contains a space, then it needs to be in brackets and string notation.

Logical testing
Let's practice writing logical statements and displaying the output.

Recall that we use the following operators:

== tests that two values are equal.
!= tests that two values are not equal.
> and < test that greater than or less than, respectively.
>= and <= test greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, respectively.

Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2.
Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing.
Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle.

# Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2

print(greater_than_2)

# Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing
still_missing = mpr[mpr['Status']  == 'Still Missing']
print(still_missing)

# Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle
not_poodle = mpr[mpr['Dog Breed']  != 'Poodle']
print(not_poodle)

Narrowing the list of suspects
In Chapter 1, we found a list of people whose cars matched the description of the one that kidnapped Bayes:

Fred Frequentist
Ronald Aylmer Fisher
Gertrude Cox
Kirstine Smith
We'd like to narrow this list down, so we obtained credit card records for each suspect. We'd like to know if any of them recently purchased dog treats to use in the kidnapping. If they did, they would have visited 'Pet Paradise'.

The credit records have been loaded into a DataFrame called credit_records.

Working hard
Several police officers have been working hard to help us solve the mystery of Bayes, the kidnapped Golden Retriever. Their commanding officer wants to know exactly how hard each officer has been working on this case. Officer Deshaun has created DataFrames called deshaun to track the amount of time he spent working on this case. The DataFrame contains two columns:

day_of_week: a string representing the day of the week
hours_worked: the number of hours that a particular officer worked on the Bayes case'

Or hardly working?
Two other officers have been working with Deshaun to help find Bayes. Their names are Officer Mengfei and Officer Aditya. Deshaun used their time cards to create two more DataFrames: mengfei and aditya. In this exercise, we'll plot all three lines together to see who was working hard each day.

Question
One of the officers did not start working on the case until Wednesday. Which officer?

Mengfei




Adding labels
If we give a chart with no labels to Officer Deshaun's supervisor, she won't know what the lines represent.

We need to add labels to Officer Deshaun's plot of hours worked.

Instructions
100 XP
Add a descriptive title to the chart.
Add a label for the y-axis.

# Lines

Adding floating text
Officer Deshaun is examining the number of hours that he worked over the past six months. The number for June is low because he only had data for the first week. Help Deshaun add an annotation to the graph to explain this.

Instructions
100 XP
Place the annotation "Missing June data" at the point (2.5, 80).

# Create plot

Tracking crime statistics
Sergeant Laura wants to do some background research to help her better understand the cultural context for Bayes' kidnapping. She has plotted Burglary rates in three U.S. cities using data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics.

She wants to present this data to her officers, and she wants the image to be as beautiful as possible to effectively tell her data story.

Recall:

You can change linestyle to dotted (':'), dashed('--'), or no line ('').
You can change the marker to circle ('o'), diamond('d'), or square ('s').

Identifying Bayes' kidnapper
We've narrowed the possible kidnappers down to two suspects:

Fred Frequentist (suspect1)
Gertrude Cox (suspect2)
The kidnapper left a long ransom note containing several unusual phrases. Help DataCamp by using a line plot to compare the frequency of letters in the ransom note to samples from the two main suspects.

Three DataFrames have been loaded:

ransom contains the letter frequencies for the ransom note.
suspect1 contains the letter frequencies for the sample from Fred Frequentist.
suspect2 contains the letter frequencies for the sample from Gertrude Cox.
Each DataFrame contain two columns letter and frequency.

Instructions 1/4

Charting cellphone data
We know that Freddy Frequentist is the one who kidnapped Bayes the Golden Retriever. Now we need to learn where he is hiding.

Our friends at the police station have acquired cell phone data, which gives some of Freddie's locations over the past three weeks. It's stored in the DataFrame cellphone. The x-coordinates are in the column 'x' and the y-coordinates are in the column 'y'.

The matplotlib module has been imported under the alias plt.

Instructions
100 XP
Display the first five rows of the DataFrame and determine which columns to plot.
Create a scatter plot of the data in cellphone.

# Explore the data
print(cellphone.head())

# Create a scatter plot of the data from the DataFrame cellphone
plt.scatter(cellphone.x, cellphone.y)

# Add labels
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Modifying a scatterplot
In the previous exercise, we created a scatter plot to show Freddy Frequentist's cell phone data.

In this exercise, we've done some magic so that the plot will appear over a map of our town. If we just plot the data as we did before, we won't be able to see the map or pick out the areas with the most points. We can fix this by changing the colors, markers, and transparency of the scatter plot.

As before, the matplotlib.pyplot module has been imported under the alias plt, and the cellphone data is in the DataFrame cellphone.

Build a simple bar chart
Officer Deshaun wants to plot the average number of hours worked per week for him and his coworkers. He has stored the hours worked in a DataFrame called hours, which has columns officer and avg_hours_worked. Recall that the function plt.bar() takes two arguments: the labels for each bar, and the height of each bar. Both of these can be found in our DataFrame.

Display the DataFrame hours using a print command.

# Display the DataFrame hours using print
print(hours)

Create a bar chart of the column avg_hours_worked for each officer from the DataFrame hours.

# Display the DataFrame hours using print
print(hours)

# Create a bar plot from the DataFrame hours
plt.bar(hours.officer, hours.avg_hours_worked)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Use the column std_hours_worked (the standard deviation of the hours worked) to add error bars to the bar chart.

# Display the DataFrame hours using print
print(hours)

# Create a bar plot from the DataFrame hours
plt.bar(hours.officer, hours.avg_hours_worked,
        # Add error bars
        yerr =hours.std_hours_worked)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Where did the time go?
Officer Deshaun wants to compare the hours spent on field work and desk work between him and his colleagues. In this DataFrame, he has split out the average hours worked per week into desk_work and field_work.

You can use the same DataFrame containing the hours worked from the previous exercise (hours).

Create a bar plot of the time each officer spends on desk_work.
Label that bar plot "Desk Work".

# Plot the number of hours spent on desk work
plt.bar(hours.officer , hours.desk_work , label='Desk Work')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Create a bar plot for field_work whose bottom is the height of desk_work.
Label the field_work bars as "Field Work" and add a legend.

# Plot the number of hours spent on desk work
plt.bar(hours.officer, hours.desk_work, label='Desk Work')

# Plot the hours spent on field work on top of desk work
plt.bar(hours.officer, hours.field_work,
        bottom=hours.desk_work, label='Field Work')

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()


Modifying histograms
Let's explore how changes to keyword parameters in a histogram can change the output. Recall that:

range sets the minimum and maximum datapoints that we will include in our histogram.
bins sets the number of points in our histogram.
We'll be exploring the weights of various puppies from the DataFrame puppies. matplotlib has been loaded under the alias plt.

Instructions 1/3
35 XP
1
Create a histogram of the column weight from the DataFrame puppies.

# Create a histogram of the column weight from the DataFrame puppies
plt.hist(puppies.weight)

# Add labels
plt.xlabel('Puppy Weight (lbs)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Puppies')

# Display
plt.show()

Change the number of bins to 50.

# Change the number of bins to 50
plt.hist(puppies.weight,
        bins=50)

# Add labels
plt.xlabel('Puppy Weight (lbs)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Puppies')

# Display
plt.show()

Change the range to start at 5 and end at 35.

# Change the range to start at 5 and end at 35
plt.hist(puppies.weight,
        range=(5, 35))

# Add labels
plt.xlabel('Puppy Weight (lbs)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Puppies')

# Display
plt.show()

Heroes with histograms
We've identified that the kidnapper is Fred Frequentist. Now we need to know where Fred is hiding Bayes.

A shoe print at the crime scene contains a specific type of gravel. Based on the distribution of gravel radii, we can determine where the kidnapper recently visited. It might be:

blue-meadows-park
shady-groves-campsite
happy-mountain-trailhead
The radii of individual gravel pieces has been loaded into the DataFrame gravel, and matplotlib has been loaded under the alias plt.

Create a histogram of gravel.radius.

# Create a histogram of gravel.radius
plt.hist(gravel.radius)

# Display histogram
plt.show()

Modify the histogram such that the histogram is divided into 40 bins and the range is from 2 to 8.

# Create a histogram
# Range is 2 to 8, with 40 bins
plt.hist(gravel.radius, bins = 40, range = (2,8))

# Display histogram
plt.show()

Normalize your histogram so that the sum of the bins adds to 1.

# Create a histogram
# Normalize to 1
plt.hist(gravel.radius,
         bins=40,
         range=(2, 8),
         density = True )

# Display histogram
plt.show()


Label the x-axis (Gravel Radius (mm)), the y-axis (Frequency), and add the title (Sample from Shoeprint).

# Create a histogram
plt.hist(gravel.radius,
         bins=40,
         range=(2, 8),
         density=True)

# Label plot
plt.xlabel('Gravel Radius (mm)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Sample from Shoeprint')

# Display histogram
plt.show()
